# Roll_A_Dice
This Python code simulates rolling of a dice 
This Python script simulates the roll of a standard six-sided dice using the random module. Each time the code is executed, it generates a random integer between 1 and 6, inclusive, which represents the outcome of a dice roll.
It uses concepts such as randomness, importing libraries, and control flow.
The program prints the result to the console, providing a simple and interactive way to mimic the behavior of a physical dice
